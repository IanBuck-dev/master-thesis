\chapter{Preparation of Datasets}
\label{chap:preparations data sets}
% Todo: 6 pages?

goals:
- dataset to train and validate different types of regression models
- target variable: air temperature
- input variables:
    - weather station measurements (air temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, percipitation)
    - satellite data (surface temperature, surface roughness, soil temperature, land coverage indexes, sky view factor, ...)

    Need to separate between reference grade data (weather station calibrated), and low-cost sensors without placement information

% \section{Automated Data Collection}

% Build Netatmo api connector, load data

\section{Overview Data Sources}
Reference data: DWD station data (see https://dwd-geoportal.de/products/OBS\_DEU\_PT10M\_T2M/) -> 10 min 2m height air temperature
https://opendata.dwd.de/climate\_environment/CDC/observations\_germany/climate/10\_minutes/air\_temperature/recent/

need to write script to download all files and for each file do some conversion to csv


- overview of sources for good datasets for temperature and climate related research

goal:
- collect mutiple datasets (many features, fine-granualar spaciotemporal)
- enhance datasets with additonal information (soil conditions, zoning plans, vegetation health)
