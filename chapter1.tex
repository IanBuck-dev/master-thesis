 In 2023 56\% of the human population already lives in urban areas with the number projected to continiously increase to 68\% by 2050 \footnote{https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization\#by-2050-more-than-two-thirds-of-the-world-will-live-in-urban-areas}. Combined with the ongoing climate change and urban densification, cities are facing many new challenges. With the removal of vegetation in favor of living space and the sealing of surfaces with heat-absorbing materials such as asphalt or concrete for streets and highways \cite{gret2020urban}, rising temperatures lead to new phenomena that pose risks for the urban citizens. A recent phenomenon is the appearance of so called urban heat-islands (UHI). A heat-island is a local occurrence of significantly higher temperatures than surrounding areas that pose a health risk, especially for the elderly, children or citizen with prior health-issues \cite{martin2015alternative}.\\

In order to detect UHIs, Land Surface Temperature (LST) is commonly used. While allowing for a cheap analysis of large areas without the need of ground weather-stations, this approach comes with certain downsides, such as low temporal and spatial resolution and restrictions such as only being able to measure temperatures when no clouds interfere with the microwaces send from the measuring satellite \cite{zhang2015estimation}. This spatial and temporal resolution, of f.e. spatial resolution of 0.01° longitude and 0.01° latitude (equal to roughly 1.11km by 1.11km) and temporal resolution of monthly average surface temperature as offered by LST data provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Office's data set \cite{ghent2022esalst}, is not enough to effectively analyze the urban microclimate. Another candidate that comes to mind are weather stations. They usually provide hourly, for current values sometimes even 10 min interval readings of temperature, rain and wind, but don't offer the necessary spatial resolution.
Lastly, there is the possibility of deploying sensor networks to closely monitor the climate of the city, but this approach can be quite cost intensive for a large amount of sensors over a long time period \cite{chapman2015birmingham}. An alternative that is less costly would be to instead rely on citizen-owned sensor networks from the existing Smart Home and Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, like Sensor.Community \footnote{https://deutschland.maps.sensor.community/} and Netatmo \footnote{https://weathermap.netatmo.com/}, which offer a temporal resolution of 5 min for temperature and wind, hourly for rain, while also having a comparably high spatial resolution. This approach has the desired temporal resolution and has been shown to work well in \cite{meier2017crowdsourcing}, but there might be areas, such as industrial zones, where citizens are not able or not allowed to install their personal sensors. In order to also gain insights in such previously unobserved areas, we propose the usage of mobile sensors that could be installed on buses, bikes or e-scooters to gain temporary snapshots and improve the spatial resolution even further.
As research realted activities commonly rely on continuous or gridded data fields, there needs to be a way to convert these single data points from the different sensors into a continuous data-layer.\\
In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by training a machine learning regression model, that allows for the interpolation of missing data-points. Based on sensor readings, from the sensor networks and mobile sensors, of commonly collected weather information, such as temperature, humidity, rain, pressure, wind, and possibly other variables such as vegetation indexes \cite{alonso2020new}, the model then creates a continuous data-layer that allows for a holistic view of the observed variable, in this case temperature.\\

\section{Objective}

current situation: abundance of data (data quality unknown), but different data sources at different places with different formats, making it hard to work with different sources at the same time
- smart city example -> heat island detection
    - sensor networks (statinary + mobile)
    - LST satellite data (lack of spatiotemporal resolution, not suited for micro-climate)
    - vegetation indexes (in geoinformation systems/portals)
    - etc.
- currently these sources are used independently from each other, but how can they be integrated?
    - hybrid approaches have shown that combining different approaches (smart city stationary + moving sensors) to give better prediction quality than singular approach (reasons: unobserved areas)
    - statistical models offer not enough flexibility/are to cumbersom to work with (and probabilities are not known)
    - ML is a good fit to analyse patterns and rules
- how can ML be used to integrate the different types of data?
- what work needs to be done before using the data in ML (preprocessing, transformation, outlier detection etc.)
    - one way of preparing data is to interpolate missing data to create continous gridded features (focus of this work)
    - how ML can we improve the interpolation quality of features? -> turn sparse features into denser versions with interpolation, interpolation based on other features present

In order to validate these things, we need high quality data-sets with many different features, but there are not many available, even tho for certain things (atmosphere etc.) there are OpenData sets available.
Goal of this work is to create good data-sets that can be used to train and validate different methods, like ML approaches

% Strucure of the thesis
The rest of the thesis is structured as follows. Chapter \ref{chap:Related Work} begins with an analysis of related work, where important literature is discussed, that forms the foundation of this research. In chapter \ref{chap:System Architecture}, the focus lies on describing the service architecture, that shows how a machine learning model can be deployed in different contexts to improve data availability. Which machine learning approaches can be used to interpolate missing data and how they differ from each other is discussed in chapter \ref{chap:Machine Learning Model Design}. In Chapter \ref{chap:Evaluation}, the different ML approaches are compared and cross validated with each other based on the different model that are trained on the obtained data-sets. Finally, chapter \ref{chap:Conclusion} discusses the findings of this thesis and gives an outlook into future work and research directions.
